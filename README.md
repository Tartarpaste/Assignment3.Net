#### MagicTord-N-SondreTheWebAPI

This repo contains a web application that generates a local database that can be manipulated by controllers. The content of the repo represents characters that play in movies and franchises that these movies are a part of. A user can with swagger manipulate the locally generated database with general CRUD and some custom methods for the different database tables.
